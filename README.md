# Automatic Vectorization Compiler and Optimizer

Created by Dalton Caron.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn more about compiler construction by 
building a toy compiler capable of automatically vectorizing for loops. The 
compiler generates code for Linux x86_64 platforms. Vectorized code requires up 
to the AVX-2 x86_64 instruction set extensions.
